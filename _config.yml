  Hello, my name is Andrew and I'm a driven software engineer, tinkerer and lifelong learner. Recently, I graduated from UVM where my experiences spanned machine learning, software development and renewable energy systems. Proficient in <mark>Python</mark>, skilled in <mark>PHP</mark>, <mark>Git</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>Git</mark>, Linux CLI, and data analysis. I excel at developing efficient, practical solutions to complex problems and collaborating in multidisciplinary teams to achieve project goals.

          I completed this project as part of an Evolutionary Computation class during the fall semester of my senior year at UVM. What began as a final project for the class quickly grew in scope and was an invaluable experience in both computing and project management. During this project, I created a custom data structure inspired by Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CCPNs) to represent algebraic formulae. Furthermore, I had foundational lessons about the importance data integrity and data version control for machine learning efforts.

          A full-stack HTML/PHP website for University of Vermont students to buy and sell bicycles.
        description: |
          This was the final project for a Database Design for Web class I took during the spring semester of my junior year at UVM. This website is a used bicycle marketplace forum for UVM students, staff and faculty. The site uses PHP to read and write from relational databases that store user's information and their listings. The site also has capabilities for users to get in touch with one another securely to arrange sales. There is also an admin section of the website protected by htaccess so only users with approved UVM NetIDs can edit all listings on the website.

          This was the first truly self-directed semester long project I had to complete in college, and it was a blast. The goal of the project was to make a device that would plug into any modern vehicle's OBD-II interface and display relevant engine data to the user. This project utilizes the python-OBD library to read data from the car's ECU and then the pyGame library to create a basic graphical user interface that formats the data in a useful manner. I particularly enjoyed this project as I was able to combine computing with my interest in cars, and see how technology can benefit a user's experience in a vehicle.

          During my time at UVM, I achieved a GPA of 3.6/4.0 and cultivated keys skills such as teamwork and time management. I thoroughly enjoyed both my coursework and free time as a university student, learning a lot about work-life balance and the value of making strong social connections with your peers.
          
          I spent nearly all of my free time enjoying Vermont's natural beauty, and was involved with the <mark>UVM Alpine Ski Racing Club</mark>, serving on the executive board for two years.
